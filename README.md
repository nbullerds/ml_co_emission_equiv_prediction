# Project-3-Carbon Emissions Predictor
## IMPACT OF ELECTRIFYING TRANSPORTATION IN THE UNITED STATES


This project is to determine the predictability of reducing carbon emissions in the transportation sector by replacing internal combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles (EV).

## Overview

Transportation makes up a large portion of the total US greenhouse gas emissions. Can the transition away from internal combustion vehicle types help to reduce these emissions in the United States?

Governmental and NGO policies during the Covid-19 pandemic changed human behavior resulting in decreased energy demand. At the peak in April of 2020, daily global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions decrease 19% compared to 2019.

Data from various sources was used to test-train a dataset that shows carbon emissions before, during, and after the Covid-19 pandemic to determine the predictability of reducing carbon emission in the transportation sector by replacing internal combustion vehicles with EVs.

Assumptions:
* This project looks at the carbon impact from transportation in the US only. 
* It assumes the future EVs will use energy from renewable sources (solar and wind) and not from coal-or gas-fired energy generation. 
* This project also does not take into account the effects of manufacturing or lifecycle issues of EV batteries.
