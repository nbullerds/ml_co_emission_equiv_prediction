319,US,Alternative Fuel Excise Tax Credit,"A tax incentive is available for alternative fuel that is sold for use
or used as a fuel to operate a motor vehicle. A tax credit in the amount
of \$0.50 per gallon is available for the following alternative fuels:
natural gas, liquefied hydrogen, propane, P-Series fuel, liquid fuel
derived from coal through the Fischer-Tropsch process, and compressed or
liquefied gas derived from biomass. For propane and natural gas sold
after December 31, 2015, the tax credit is based on the gasoline gallon
equivalent (GGE) or diesel gallon equivalent (DGE). For taxation
purposes, one GGE is equal to 5.75 pounds (lbs.) of propane and 5.66
lbs. of compressed natural gas. One DGE is equal to 6.06 lbs. of
liquefied natural gas.

For an entity to be eligible to claim the credit they must be liable for
reporting and paying the federal excise tax on the sale or use of the
fuel in a motor vehicle. Tax exempt entities such as state and local
governments that dispense qualified fuel from an on-site fueling station
for use in vehicles qualify for the incentive. Eligible entities must be
registered with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The incentive must
first be taken as a credit against the entity\'s alternative fuel tax
liability; any excess over this fuel tax liability may be claimed as a
direct payment from the IRS. The tax credit is not allowed if an
incentive for the same alternative fuel is also determined under the
rules for the ethanol or biodiesel tax credits.

347,US,Vehicle Acquisition and Fuel Use Requirements for State and Alternative Fuel Provider Fleets,"Under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, as amended, certain state
government and alternative fuel provider fleets are required to acquire
alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) as a portion of their annual light-duty
vehicle acquisitions. Compliance is required by fleets that operate,
lease, or control 50 or more light-duty vehicles within the United
States. Of those 50 vehicles, at least 20 must be used primarily within
a single Metropolitan Statistical Area/Consolidated Metropolitan
Statistical Area, and those same 20 vehicles must also be capable of
being centrally fueled for the fleet to be subject to the regulatory
requirements.

Under [Standard
Compliance](https://epact.energy.gov/standard-compliance), the AFVs that
covered fleets acquire help them achieve compliance, with each AFV
acquired earning the fleet one AFV-acquisition credit. Covered fleets
may earn additional credits for AFVs earned in excess of their
requirements, and these credits may be banked for future use toward
compliance or traded with other fleets. Additionally, fleets that use
fuel blends containing at least 20% biodiesel (B20) in medium- and
heavy-duty vehicles may earn credits toward their annual AFV-acquisition
requirements. A fleet may also earn credits that may be used toward
compliance or banked once the fleet achieves compliance for investments
in alternative fuel infrastructure, mobile non-road equipment, and
emerging technologies associated with certain electric drive vehicle
technologies.

Fleets may also opt into [Alternative
Compliance](https://epact.energy.gov/alternative-compliance), which
allows fleets the option to choose a petroleum reduction path in lieu of
acquiring AFVs under Standard Compliance. Interested fleets must obtain
from DOE a waiver from Standard Compliance by submitting a plan that
demonstrates a path by which they will achieve a certain level of
petroleum reduction specific to their fleet composition.

vehicles (AFVs). As amended in January 2008, Section 301 of EPAct 1992
expands the definition of AFVs to include hybrid electric vehicles, fuel
cell vehicles, and advanced lean burn vehicles. Fleets that use fuel
blends containing at least 20% biodiesel (B20) may earn credits toward
their annual requirements. Federal fleets are also required to use
alternative fuels in dual-fuel vehicles unless the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) approves waivers for agency vehicles; grounds for a waiver
include lack of alternative fuel availability and unreasonable cost (per
EPAct 2005, section 701).

Additional requirements for federal fleets were included in the [Energy
Independence and Security Act of
2007](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/laws/eisa), such as fleet management
plans and petroleum reduction from 2005 levels (Section 142), low
greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting vehicle acquisition requirements (Section
141), and renewable fuel infrastructure installation requirements
(Section 246). For more information, see the [Federal Fleet
Management](https://federalfleets.energy.gov/) website.

To track progress toward meeting AFV acquisition and fuel use
requirements, federal fleets must report on their percent alternative
fuel increase compared to the fiscal year 2005 baseline, alternative
fuel use as a percentage of total fuel consumption, AFV acquisitions as
a percentage of vehicle acquisitions, and fleet-wide miles per gasoline
gallon equivalent of petroleum fuels.

Executive Order 13834, issued in May 2018, requires the Secretary of
Energy (Secretary), in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, the
Administrator of General Services, and the heads of other agencies as
appropriate, to review the existing federal vehicle fleet requirements.
In April 2019, the Secretary provided a report to the Chairman of the

-   Reduce vehicle miles traveled
-   Implement more fuel efficient vehicles
-   Align the implementation of AFVs and associated fueling
    infrastructure

385,US,Vehicle Fuel Economy and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Standards,"Vehicle manufacturers must meet fuel economy and GHG emissions standards
for vehicles sold in the United States. The U.S. Department of
Transportation\'s (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) regulates fuel economy standards, while the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) regulates GHG emissions.

NHTSA\'s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program and EPA\'s
light-duty vehicle GHG emissions program set standards for passenger
cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles. By Model
Year (MY) 2025, these vehicles must meet an estimated combined average
fuel economy of 48.7 to 49.7 miles per gallon or higher. The standards
provide flexibility to manufacturers, including the ability to earn
credits for alternative fuel vehicles. For information on the standards
from MY 2017-2025, see the [final
rule](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-10-15/pdf/2012-21972.pdf) in
the Federal Register.

NHTSA and EPA also regulate fuel economy and GHG emissions for on-road
vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 8,500 pounds or
greater and the engines that power them. For MY 2014-2018 medium- and
heavy-duty vehicles that are not already covered by the standards
described above, manufacturers must meet increasingly stringent fuel
economy and GHG emissions standards tailored to each of three main
regulatory subcategories: combination tractors (also known as semi
trucks); heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans; and vocational vehicles
(such as delivery, refuse, and tow trucks; transit, shuttle, and school
buses; and emergency vehicles). The standards provide flexibility,
allowing for emissions and/or fuel consumption credits to be averaged,
banked, or traded. For more information, refer to the [final

390,US,Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Program,"The national RFS Program was developed to increase the volume of
renewable fuel that is blended into transportation fuels. As required by
the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) finalized RFS Program regulations, effective September 1, 2007.
The [Energy Independence and Security Act of
2007](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/laws/eisa) (EISA) increased and
expanded this standard. By 2022, 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel
must be blended into domestic transportation fuels each year. A certain
percentage of this renewable fuel must be advanced biofuel, which
includes fuels derived from approved renewable biomass, excluding corn
starch-based ethanol. Other advanced biofuels may include
sugarcane-based fuels, renewable diesel co-processed with petroleum, and
other biofuels that may exist in the future. All advanced biofuels must
achieve a minimum of a 50% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction
compared to baseline petroleum emissions. Nested within advanced
biofuels are two sub-categories: cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based
diesel, both of which have their own percentage requirements. Cellulosic
biofuel is defined as any renewable fuel derived from cellulose,
hemicellulose, or lignin that achieves a 60% GHG emissions reduction.
Biomass-based diesel is defined as a renewable transportation fuel,
transportation fuel additive, heating oil, or jet fuel, such as
biodiesel or non-ester renewable diesel, and achieves a 50% GHG
emissions reduction. If intended for use in a motor vehicle, the fuel
must also be registered with EPA as a motor vehicle fuel or fuel
additive.

Each year, EPA determines the annual percentage standards by dividing
the annual amount of renewable fuel (gallons) required by EISA for each
renewable fuel pathway by the amount of highway and non-road gasoline
and petroleum diesel estimated to be supplied that year. These
percentages are then applied to obligated parties\' actual fuel sales to
determine their Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO). Any party that
produces gasoline for use in the United States, including refiners,
importers, and blenders (other than oxygenate blenders), is considered
an obligated party under the RFS Program. Parties that do not produce,
import, or market fuels within the 48 contiguous states are exempt from
the renewable fuel tracking program.

To facilitate and track compliance with the RFS, a producer or importer
of renewable fuel must generate Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs)
to represent renewable fuels produced or imported by the entity on or
after September 1, 2007, assigned by gallon or batch. Assigned RINs are
transferred when ownership of a batch of fuel occurs, but not when fuel
only changes custody. A trading program is in place to allow obligated
parties to comply with their annual RVO requirements through the
purchase of RINs. Obligated parties must register with EPA in order to
participate in the trading program. For each calendar year, an obligated
party must demonstrate that it has sufficient RINs to cover its RVO.
RINs may only be used for compliance purposes in the calendar year they
are generated or the following year. Obligated parties must report their
ownership of RINs to EPA\'s Office of Transportation and Air Quality on
a quarterly and annual basis.

light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles as ZEVs if the
vehicles produce zero exhaust emissions of any criteria pollutant (or
precursor pollutant) under any and all possible operational modes and
conditions.

Manufacturers with annual sales between 4,501 and 60,000 vehicles may
comply with the ZEV requirements through multiple alternative compliance
options that include producing low emission vehicles and obtaining ZEV
credits. Manufacturers with annual sales of 4,500 vehicles or less are
not subject to this regulation.

ARB\'s emissions control program for MY 2017 through 2025 combines the
control of smog, soot, and greenhouse gases (GHGs) and requirements for
ZEVs into a single package of standards called Advanced Clean Cars. In
December 2012, ARB finalized new regulatory requirements that allow
vehicle manufacturer compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency\'s GHG requirements for MY 2017-2025 to serve as compliance with
California\'s adopted GHG emissions requirements for those same model
years.

The accounting procedures for MY 2018-2025 are based on a credit system
as shown in the table below. The minimum ZEV requirement for each
manufacturer includes the percentage of passenger cars and light-duty
trucks produced by the manufacturer and delivered for sale in
California. The regulation also includes opportunities for compliance
with transitional zero emission vehicles, which must demonstrate certain
exhaust emissions standards, evaporative emissions standards, on-board
diagnostic requirements, and extended warranties.

from California\'s ports and intermodal rail facilities. The rule
requires that certain drayage trucks be equipped with VDECS and that all
applicable vehicles have engines certified to the 2007 emissions
standards. By January 1, 2023, all applicable vehicles must have engines
certified to 2010 standards. The [solid waste collection vehicle

Ethanol is defined an ethyl alcohol that has a purity of at least 99%,
exclusive of added denaturants; meets U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms, and Explosives and ASTM specification D4806; and is produced
from domestic agricultural or biomass products. This requirement will

gallon of Louisiana-manufactured ethanol, less any federal tax
incentives or credits, is equal to or below the average wholesale price
of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline in Louisiana for a period of
not less than 60 days, as determined by the Louisiana Department of
Agriculture and Forestry (Department).

Within six months following the point at which monthly production of
biodiesel produced in the state equals or exceeds a minimum annualized
production volume of 10 million gallons, at least 2% of the total diesel
sold by volume in the state must be biodiesel produced from domestically
grown feedstock. Biodiesel is a fuel comprised of mono-alkyl esters of
long chain fatty acids derived from renewable resources and meeting the
requirements of ASTM specification D6751, or a diesel fuel substitute
produced from non-petroleum renewable resources such as vegetable oils
and animal fats that meet U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fuel and
fuel additive requirements.

Alternatively, these requirements may be met through the production of
an alternate renewable fuel, defined as a liquid fuel that is
domestically produced from renewable biomass, can be used in place of
ethanol or biodiesel, and meets the definition of renewable fuel in the
Energy Policy Act of 2005. Within six months following the point at
which cumulative monthly production of an alternate renewable fuel
produced in the state equals or exceeds a minimum annual production
volume of 20 million gallons, at least 2% of the total motor fuel sold
by volume in the state must be the alternate renewable fuel produced
from domestically grown feedstock. This requirement may not exceed 2% of
the total motor fuel sold by volume by owners or operators of fuel
distribution terminals.

Blenders and retailers will have six months to meet the new minimum
ethanol, biodiesel, or alternate renewable fuel content requirements,
unless the Louisiana Commission of Weights and Measures determines that
the quality or supply of ethanol or biodiesel in the state is
insufficient or fuel distributors are unable to blend ethanol due to
delays in obtaining permits or constructing ethanol blending or storage
equipment. Any combination of alternative fuels, including but not
limited to denatured ethanol, biodiesel, and alternative renewable fuel
may be used to meet these requirements. Fuels containing ethanol or
biodiesel will not be required to be sold in ozone nonattainment areas.
The Department will adopt rules and regulations requiring incentives to
compensate for any costs associated with achieving the minimum ethanol
and biodiesel standards. The Department defines domestically grown
feedstock to include any feedstock produced in the United States.
Because in-state volume requirements are currently being met through the
U.S. [Renewable Fuel

reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels that are sold,
supplied, or offered for sale in the state by a minimum of 10% by 2020.
The California Air Resources Board (ARB) regulations require
transportation fuel producers and importers to meet specified average
carbon intensity requirements for fuel. In the regulations, carbon
intensity reductions are based on reformulated gasoline mixed with 10%
corn-derived ethanol and low-sulfur diesel fuel. Propane is exempt from
LCFS requirements, as are non-biomass-based alternative fuels that are
supplied in California for use in transportation at an aggregated volume
of less than 3.6 million gasoline gallon equivalents per year. Other
exemptions apply for transportation fuel used in specific applications.
The LCFS Program allows producers and importers to generate, acquire,
transfer, bank, borrow, and trade credits. Fuel producers and importers
regulated under the LCFS must meet quarterly and annual reporting
requirements. For more information, see the [LCFS

6583,TX,Clean Fleet Grants,"The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) administers the
Texas Clean Fleet Program (TCFP) as part of the Texas Emissions
Reduction Plan (TERP). TCFP encourages owners of fleets containing
diesel vehicles to permanently remove the vehicles from the road and
replace them with alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) or hybrid electric
vehicles (HEVs). Grants are available to fleets to offset the
incremental cost of such replacement projects. An entity that operates a
fleet of at least 75 vehicles and commits to placing 20 or more
qualifying vehicles in service for use in the Clean Transportation Zone
may be eligible. Qualifying AFV or HEV replacements must reduce
emissions of nitrogen oxides or other pollutants by at least 25% as
compared to baseline levels and must replace vehicles that meet
operational and fuel usage requirements. Neighborhood electric vehicles
do not qualify. For more information, including current application

10212,CA,Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Promotion Plan,"All California state agencies must support and facilitate the rapid
commercialization of ZEVs in California. In particular, the Air
Resources Board, Energy Commission (CEC), Public Utilities Commission,
and other relevant state agencies must work with the private sector to
establish benchmarks to achieve targets for ZEV commercialization and
deployment. These targets include:

-   By 2020, the state will have established adequate infrastructure to
    support one million ZEVs;
-   By 2025, there will be 1.5 million ZEVs on the road in California
    and clean, efficient vehicles will displace 1.5 billion gallons of
    petroleum fuels annually;
-   By 2025, there will be 200 hydrogen fueling stations and 250,000
    plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) chargers, including 10,000 direct
    current fast chargers, in California;
-   By 2030, there will be 5 million ZEVs on the road in California; and
-   By 2050, greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector
    will be 80% less than 1990 levels.

State agencies must also work with their stakeholders to accomplish the
following:

-   Develop new criteria for clean vehicle incentive programs to
    encourage manufacturers to produce clean, affordable cars;
-   Update the 2016 ZEV Action plan, with a focus on low income and
    disadvantaged communities;
-   Recommend actions to increase the deployment of ZEV infrastructure
    through the Low Carbon Fuel Standard;
-   Support and recommend policies that will facilitate the installation
    of PEV infrastructure in homes and businesses; and
-   Ensure PEV charging and hydrogen fueling are affordable and
    accessible to all drivers.

The ZEV promotion plan additionally directs the state fleet to increase
the number of ZEVs in the fleet through gradual vehicle replacement. By
2020, ZEVs should make up at least 25% of the fleet\'s light-duty
vehicles. Vehicles with special performance requirements necessary for
public safety and welfare are exempt from this requirement. For more
information about the plan, see CEC\'s [ZEVs and Infrastructure
Update](https://static.business.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2018-ZEV-Action-Plan-Priorities-Update.pdf).

10515,US,Second Generation Biofuel Producer Tax Credit,"A second generation biofuel producer that is registered with the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may be eligible for a tax incentive in
the amount of up to \$1.01 per gallon of second generation biofuel that
is: sold and used by the purchaser in the purchaser\'s trade or business
to produce a second generation biofuel mixture; sold and used by the
purchaser as a fuel in a trade or business; sold at retail for use as a
motor vehicle fuel; used by the producer in a trade or business to
produce a second generation biofuel mixture; or used by the producer as
a fuel in a trade or business. If the second generation biofuel also
qualifies for alcohol fuel tax credits, the credit amount is reduced to
\$0.46 per gallon for biofuel that is ethanol and \$0.41 per gallon if
the biofuel is not ethanol. Second generation biofuel is defined as
liquid fuel produced from any lignocellulosic or hemicellulosic matter
that is available on a renewable basis or any cultivated algae,
cyanobacteria, or lemna. To qualify, fuel must also meet the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency fuel and fuel additive registration
requirements. Alcohol with a proof of less than 150, fuel with a water
or sediment content of more than 4%, and fuel with an ash content of
more than 1% are not considered second generation biofuels. The
incentive is allowed as a credit against the producer\'s income tax
liability. Under current law, only qualified fuel produced in the United
States for use in the United States may be eligible. For more
information about claiming the credit, see IRS Forms 637 and 6478, which
are available on the [IRS Forms and

11167,CA,Hydrogen Fueling Station Evaluation,"The California Air Resources Board (ARB) may not enforce any element of
regulations that would require a supplier to construct, operate, or
provide funding to construct or operate a publicly available hydrogen
fueling station.

Annually, ARB must aggregate and share the number of hydrogen vehicles
that manufacturers project will be sold or leased over the next three
years and the total number of hydrogen vehicle registered in the state.
Based on this information, ARB must evaluate the need for additional
publicly available hydrogen fueling stations for the subsequent three
years and report findings to the California Energy Commission (CEC)
including the of number of stations, geographic areas where stations are
needed, and minimum operating standards, such as number of dispensers
and filling pressures.

The CEC will allocate up to \$20 million per year to fund the number of
stations deemed necessary based on ARB\'s evaluation and reports. The
CEC may stop funding new stations if it determines, in consultation with
ARB, that the private sector is developing publicly available stations
without the need for government support.

The CEC and ARB must annually issue a report on progress toward
establishing a hydrogen fueling station network that meets the needs of
vehicles being used in the state. The review will determine the
remaining cost and time required to establish a network of 100 publicly
available hydrogen fueling stations and whether funding from the Clean
Transportation Program is necessary to achieve this goal. For more

established to coordinate efforts between state agencies to reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The EC4will pursue GHG emissions
reductions of 10% below 1990 levels by 2020, 45% below 1990 levels by
2035, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. State agencies must assist EC4
to develop programs to encourage state employees to reduce vehicle miles
traveled and use public transportation when available. The Council will
also work with municipalities to encourage sustainability; identify
federal, state, and private funding opportunities that can be leveraged
to reduce emissions in Rhode Island; and develop GHG emissions reduction
strategies. The Council submitted [a

understanding](https://www.nescaum.org/documents/zev-mou-10-governors-signed-20191120.pdf/)
(MOU) to support the deployment of ZEVs through involvement in a ZEV
Program Implementation Task Force (Task Force). In May 2014, the Task
Force published a [ZEV Action
Plan](https://www.nescaum.org/documents/multi-state-zev-action-plan.pdf)
(Plan) identifying 11 priority actions to accomplish the goals of the
MOU, including deploying at least 3.3 million ZEVs and adequate fueling
infrastructure within the signatory states by 2025. The Plan also
includes a research agenda to inform future actions. On an annual basis,
each state must report on the number of registered ZEVs, the number of
public electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) and hydrogen fueling
stations, and available information regarding workplace fueling for
ZEVs.

In June 2018, the Task Force published a new [ZEV Action
Plan](https://www.nescaum.org/documents/2018-zev-action-plan.pdf) for
2018-2021. Building on the 2014 Action Plan, the 2018 Action Plan makes
recommendations for states and other key partners in five priority
areas:

-   Raising consumer awareness and interest in electric vehicle
    technology;
-   Building out a reliable and convenient residential, workplace and
    public charging/fueling infrastructure network;
-   Continuing and improving access to consumer purchase and
    non-financial incentives;
-   Expanding public and private sector fleet adoption; and
-   Supporting dealership efforts to increase ZEV sales.
